<p>Adobe Fireworks started in 1990 as Macromedia Fireworks. In 2005 Adobe purchased Macromedia for $3.4 billion, which then allowed Fireworks to be integrated into their Creative Suite series. There have been more then ten versions of Fireworks since it was first made. There are several websites that use fireworks for their artwork. Fireworks is the most used program for web page building. Fireworks is much more efficient than Photoshop.</p>
