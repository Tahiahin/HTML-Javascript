<p>My intentions for this website were to make a website to help people learn about Adobe Fireworks on one website instead of searching through hundreds to find mostly the same information. This website is far from complete but having information gathered from the adobe homepage and other people i created a database for Fireworks. I can only hope that this website helps people learn how to make better use of Adobe Fireworks. For those who send emails to help, I check my email almost every day. If you do send an email to add information... please do not put in false information.</p>
