<p>Fireworks is used in webpages to make stylish buttons and graphics. The banner at the top of the page and the background were made in fireworks.Fireworks has many different tools and designs that the hardest part of making a picture will no longer be what to make but deciding what color or tool to pick. Some of the tools take some time to really understand what they do, while others are very simple. Some examples of hard to understand tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen Tool</li>
<li>crop tool</li>
<li>path scrubber tool</li>
<li>Marquee tool</li>
</ul>
<p>For some these may be easy to understand, but thse are just generally confusing. however the simple tools are found in even the basic art programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pencil</li>
<li>Brush</li>
<li>Eraser</li>
<li>Bucket</li>
<li>EyeDropper</li>
</ul>
<p>Fireworks can be overwhelming for someone who is not used to several choices or doesn't know what each icon means. The best way to learn how to use Fireworks is to just click buttons and test it out. Fireworks can also be used to make hotspots for image maps.</p>
